# AI_Animal_Classifier
My first AI project: animal image classifier
## 🚀 Project Overview
AI_Animal_Classifier is my first AI project, designed to classify different animal images accurately using machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates my understanding of AI fundamentals and practical implementation skills.

## 🛠 Features
- Detects and classifies animals such as cats, dogs, and birds.  
- Built with Python and popular AI libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras).  
- Clean, modular, and easy-to-extend code structure.

## 📈 Goals & Learning Outcomes
- Gain hands-on experience in AI model training and evaluation.  
- Understand image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification pipelines.  
- Learn to build scalable AI solutions for real-world applications.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Expand to include more animal categories.  
- Improve model accuracy using larger datasets and advanced architectures.  
- Develop a user-friendly web or mobile interface for demonstration.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Animal_Classifier.git

2. Install dependencies:
